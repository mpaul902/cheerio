        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The purpose of Cheerio is to aid in college students' quality of life by keeping track of their assignments, while also providing a fun incentive. As students complete tasks throughout the day, they can check them off the to-do list and feed a cheerio to their virtual dog.&nbsp;</p>

                    <span class="u-text-black"> Getting all your work done during a busy week can be really difficult! It can be really easy to procrastinate, or even just forget about a certain assignment until it's too late. This happens to the best of us, and the simple solution seems to be simply writing down your tasks somewhere to remember them. This may seem obvious, yet many students haven't cultivated these organizational habits or just haven't found a suitable medium to do as such.</span>

                    <span class="u-text-black">Although there are already numerous apps that help keep track of events and assignments, not a lot seem to provide any motivation to do so. Cheerio tries to add a little bit of fun to students' mundane daily tasks by giving them a virtual pet dog that they can care for by simply keeping track of and finishing their work. We hope that this added element will give students some more motivation to stay organized and complete their tasks on time.</span>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-3">We used SwiftUI for the user interface&nbsp;layout and functionality. Adobe Illustrator was used for any 2D vector graphics while Adobe After Effects was used to create the pet animations. We used GitHub version control to help recover and store important data.</p>

                  <h4 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-default u-text-4">Challenges</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5">We had a few issues with the database we were using to store user data as it did not seem to work with macOS too well. We were almost ready to scrap the cross-device syncing idea, but we managed to find a different database manager that wasn't too difficult to learn. We also wanted to create a web app in conjunction with what we had, but the time constraint caused us to pass on that idea.</p>

                  <h4 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-default u-text-6">What We Learned</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-7">Creating Cheerio was a great experience where we learned how to to create and convert a macOS app to iOS. It also taught us how to better design and implement ideas while properly managing our own time when working on such a project with limited time and personal.</p>
